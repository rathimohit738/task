        <h3>INDIAN ARMY</h3>
        <p>
            The Indian subcontinent had witnessed the cohesive concentration of many Empires in the quest for control of
            military power, and governance of the State. As time rolled by, societal norms found an ethos in the
            workplace, the system of rights and privileges, and service under the flag.

            The Indian Army, as we know it today became operational after the Country gained independence from British
            colonialism. The Indian Army's HQ is located in New Delhi and functions under the Chief of Army Staff
            (COAS), who is responsible for the command, control, and administration as a whole. The Army is divided into
            six operational commands (field armies) and one training command, each under the command of a Lieutenant
            General, who has an equal status to the Vice-Chief of Army Staff (VCOAS), working under the control of Army
            HQ in New Delhi.</p>
        <h3>INDIAN NAVY</h3>
        <p>The foundation of the modern Indian Navy was laid in the seventeenth century when the East India Company had
            established a maritime force, thereby graduating in time to the establishment of the Royal Indian Navy in
            1934. The Headquarters of the Indian Navy is located in New Delhi, and is under the command of the Chief of
            the naval staff â€“ an Admiral. The Indian navy is deployed under three area commands, each headed by a flag
            officer. The Western Naval Command is headquartered in Bombay on the Arabian Sea; the Southern Naval Command
            in Kochi (Cochin), in Kerala, also on the Arabian Sea; and the Eastern Naval Command in Vishakhapatnam,
            Andhra Pradesh, on the Bay of Bengal.</p>
        <h3>indian air force</h3>
        <p>The Indian Air Force was officially established on 8th October 1932, and on 1st April 1954, Air Marshal
            Subroto Mukherjee, one of the founding members of the Air Force took over as the first Indian Chief of Air
            Staff. With the passage of time, the Indian Air Force undertook massive upgrading of its aircraft and
            equipments, and as part of the process, it introduced more than twenty new types of aircrafts. The last
            decade of the twentieth century saw a phenomenal change in the structure of the Indian Air Force with
            induction of women into the Air Force for short service commissions. It was also a time when the Air Force
            undertook some of the most perilous operations ever undertaken.</p>
